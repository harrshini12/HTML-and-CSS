    <p>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn â€“ Part 1, commonly referred to as Breaking Dawn: Part 1, is a 2011 American romantic fantasy film directed by Bill Condon, based on the 2008 novel Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer.

    <p>Wyck Godfrey and Karen Rosenfelt served as producers of the film, along with the author of the series, Stephenie Meyer; the screenplay was written by Melissa Rosenberg, the screenwriter of the first three entries. It was released in theaters on November 18, 2011, and released to DVD on February 11, 2012, in the United States.

    <p>Bella Swan is preparing for her wedding. During the reception, Jacob Black, who had quickly left town upon receiving an invitation to Bella and Edward Cullen's wedding, returns.

Jacob becomes furious, knowing that such an act could kill her. Sam and other pack members restrain Jacob before he phases.</p>
